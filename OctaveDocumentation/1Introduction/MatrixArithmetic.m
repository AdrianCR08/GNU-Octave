# Octave uses standard mathematical notation with the advantage over low-level languages
# that operators may act on scalars, vector, matrices, or N-dimensional arrays. 

# Multipying matrix by a scalar 

2 * A

# To multiply the two matrices A and B, type the command

A * B

# And to form the matrix product AT A, type the command

A' * A
