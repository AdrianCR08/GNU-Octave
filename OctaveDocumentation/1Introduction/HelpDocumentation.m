# Octave has an extensive help facility. The same documentation that is available in printed
# form is also available from the Octave prompt, because both forms of the documentation
# are created from the same input file.

# In order to get good help you first need to know the name of the command that you want
# to use. The name of this function may not always be obvious, but a good place to start is to
# type

help --list

# This will show you all the operators, keywords, built-in functions, and
# loadable functions available in the current session of Octave. 

# An alternative is to search the documentation using the 

lookfor

# Once you know the name of the function you wish to use, you can get more help on the
# function by simply including the name as an argument to help.

help plot

# will display the help text for the plot function.
