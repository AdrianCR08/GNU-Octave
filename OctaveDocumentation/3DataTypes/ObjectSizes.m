# The following functions allow you to determine the size of a variable or expression. These
# functions are defined for all objects.

# They return ?1 when the operation doesn뭪 make sense. 

#{
ndims(a)
  # Return the number of dimensions of a.
For any array, the result will always be greater than or equal to 2.
Trailing singleton dimensions are not counted, i.e., tailing dimensions d greater than 2,
for which size (a, d) = 1.
#}
ndims(ones(4, 1, 2, 1))

#{
columns(a)
  Return the number of columns of a. This is equivalent to size (a, 2).
#}

#{
rows(a)
  Return the number of rows of a. This is equivalent to size (a, 1).
#}

#{
numel(a)
numel(a, idx1, idx2, ...)
  Return the number of elements in the object a.
Optionally, if indices idx1, idx2, . . . are supplied, return the number of elements that
would result from the indexing

a(idx1, idx2)

Note that the indices do not have to be scalar numbers.
#}
a = 1
b = ones(2, 3)
numel(a, b)

#{
will return 6, as this is the number of ways to index with b. Or the index could be
the string ":" which represents the colon operator. For example,
#}
a = ones(5, 3)
numel(a, 2, ":")
# will return 3 as the second row has three column entries.

#{
lenght(a)
  Return the length of the object a.
  The length is 0 for empty objects, 1 for scalars, and the number of elements for
  vectors. For matrix or N-dimensional objects, the length is the number of elements
  along the largest dimension (equivalent to max (size (a))).
#}

#{
sz = size(a)
dim_sz = size(a, dim)
[rows, clumns, ..., dim_N_sz] = size(...)
   Return a row vector with the size (number of elements) of each dimension for the object a.
   When given a second argument, dim, return the size of the corresponding dimension.
   With a single output argument, size returns a row vector.
   When called with multiple output arguments, size returns the size of dimension N in the Nth argument.
   The number of rows, dimension 1, is returned in the first argument, the number of columns,
    dimension 2, is returned in the second argument, etc. 
   If there are more dimensions in a than there are output arguments, size returns the total number of elements in
    the remaining dimensions in the final output argument.
#}

# Example 1: single row vector output
size([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
# Example 2: number of elements in 2nd dimension (columns)
size([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6], 2)
# Example 3: number of output arguments == number of dimensions
[nr, nc] = size([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
# Example 4: number of output arguments < number of dimensions
[nr, remainder] = size(ones(2, 3, 4, 5))

#{
isempty(a)
  Return true if a is an empty matrix (any one of its dimensions is zero).
#}

#{
isnull(x)
   Return true if x is a special null matrix, string, or single quoted string
   Indexed assignment with such a null value on the right-hand side should delete array elements. 
   This function is used in place of isempty when overloading the indexed assignment method (subsasgn) for user-defined classes.
   isnull is used to distinguish between these two cases:
#}

#{
sizeof(val)
   Return the size of val in bytes.
#}

#{
size_equal(a, b, ...)
   Return true if the dimensions of all arguments agree.
   Trailing singleton dimensions are ignored. 
   When called with a single argument, or no argument, size_equal returns true.
#}

#{
squeeze(x)
   Remove singleton dimensions from x and return the result.
   Note that for compatibility with matlab, all objects have a minimum of two dimensions and row vectors are left unchanged.
